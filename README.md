# balamods
Balatro mods, configured for use with Balamod.

1. Twitter Blue, which replaces the "X" icon on the main menu with the original pre-2022 Twitter icon.  Look at the code for how to change colors, and icons.png for how to replace an icon image.  Discord and Twitter icons/links could be replaced with anything you want!  Requires UwUDev's [Custom Texture Pack](https://github.com/UwUDev/balatro_mods/tree/main/custom_texture_pack/mods).

âœ¨ I documented this first mod on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3175454527).
