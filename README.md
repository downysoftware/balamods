Balatro mods, using Balamod

This is where I'll put Balatro mods, configured for use with Balamod.  The first one is Twitter Blue, which restores the "X" icon on the main menu to the original pre-2022 Twitter icon.  See the code for how to change colors, and icons.png for how to replace an icon image.  Discord and Twitter icons/links could be replaced with anything you want!

I documented this first mod on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3175454527).
